# Vanilla Harmonize
***Modpack for completely unadulterated vanilla gameplay, with extensive UX, GUI, and visual polish***

A vanilla-preserving modpack focused on interaction, interface clarity, and visual harmony. No new gameplay systems are introduced. No progression changes are made. Vanilla mechanics remain intact.

### Performance baseline
Vanilla Harmonize is built on top of the _Simply Optimized_ modpack, inheriting its carefully curated performance and stability improvements.

### Preserving Vanilla Identity
This pack intentionally preserves vanilla friction where it is fundamental to Minecraft’s gameplay identity, focusing on refinement, clarity, and feedback rather than mechanical shortcuts or automation.

### Vanilla Harmonize is not intended as an OptiFine replacement modpack
The pack focuses on interface, interaction, and visual polish while preserving vanilla gameplay.  
Beyond zoom, shaders, and dynamic lighting, other OptiFine-style features are intentionally left to player preference as optional additions.

### Playability and clarity are prioritized across all visual and interaction-focused mods
Mod configs are thoughtfully tweaked to achieve this. As an example, Physics Mod is extensively configured to avoid environmental clutter and gameplay disruption—physics objects are limited to prevent interference during exploration, mining, or multiplayer activity.

Physics behavior is also context-aware: skeletons visually disassemble into individual parts, while zombies retain standard ragdoll behavior with a controlled chance of limb breakage, reflecting their distinct vanilla identities without affecting gameplay mechanics.

Full credit to the Simply Optimized project and its contributors for Harmonize's performance. This pack expands upon its foundation with a strong focus on interface, interaction, and visual harmony.
